  ## Description
  
  This project was created to help users create and save notes similar to a to do list. This is a fully functioning application with a backend using node, and express.js. The project was also created to help further my knowledge of express and how importand the back end coding is to how a website functions and aides in helping to enhance the user experience. Creating a functioning API proved to be a challenge, however, I was able to learn the importance of naming conventions and how the server response heavily impacts what the front end of the website can do with the information that is being provided by the API. Overall this project proved to be a challenge, but it definitely helped expand my knowledge and understanding of Node and Express.
